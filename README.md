# Personal Website v2.0
This is a new website that I built with Next.JS and ChakraUI. The main goal of this project is to make it simple and scalable while keeping sound design principles. The idea is to add features as the website grows incrementally.

## What to expect
I plan to create a landing page for posts and small blogs. I also want to create more pages with '.mdx' files since I saw a couple of videos on it and thought it was quite interesting (that and the fact that I like Obsidian). I am not a UI designer, but I do love a good-looking website.
